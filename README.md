This project is a *glove-based real-time sign language translator* developed using embedded systems and basic sensors. The system uses an *Arduino Nano* board along with *flex sensors* to detect finger movements corresponding to common sign language gestures.

Upon recognizing a gesture:
- The output is displayed as *text on an LCD screen*
- Simultaneously, the spoken equivalent is played using the *DFPlayer Mini MP3 module*

The entire gesture detection and control logic is programmed using *Embedded C/C++* in the *Arduino IDE*, allowing for responsive and accurate real-time communication. This prototype demonstrates a low-cost, assistive solution to bridge the communication gap for individuals with speech or hearing impairments.
